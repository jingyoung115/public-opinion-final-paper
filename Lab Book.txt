Project: Who Says Matters: The Impact of Inclination-Oriented Media Consumption on Political Trust in China
Period: Fall 2024

## Data Processing

### September 15, 2024
**Data Cleaning Decisions:**
- Merged multiple waves of survey data (2014-2021)
- Standardized variable names across waves


### September 28, 2024
**Variable Construction:**
- Created ordinal trust measure (trust_central_4) from original categorical variable
- Recoded education levels into 8 categories for consistency across waves
- Age grouped into 9 categories (18-24, 25-29, etc.) for simulation analysis. Age grouping allows better visualization of measurement error patterns

## Statistical Analysis

### October 10, 2024
**Model Specification:**
- Chose ordered logistic regression due to ordinal nature of dependent variable
- Included control variables: gender, education, income, age, political interest, year


### October 20, 2024
**Project Proposal:**
- Discussed measurement error in the dataset
- Decided to use Monte Carlo simulation approach for testing robustness

### November 20, 2024
**Detailed Summary of the Project:**
- Discussed more specifically about potential measurement error in IV international media use and DV trust in central government
- Planned steps for conducting Monte Carlo simulation

### November 22, 2024
**Feedback of Detailed Summary of the Project:**
- Got feedback from Fred 
- Focusing on adjusting international media use based on age and education

### November 25, 2024
**Measurement Error Simulation:**
- Developed Monte Carlo simulation approach for testing robustness
- Parameters chosen:
  - 30% education adjustment, 20% age adjustment

### December 12, 2024
**Class Discussion of the Project:**
- Shared codes and comparison between adjusted and original odds ratio of international media use
- Found some errors in the codes

### December 17, 2024
**Refinement of Simulation:**
- Discussed codes of the simulation with Fred
- Changing Parameters to create different case scenarios:
  - Moderate case: 30% education adjustment, 20% age adjustment
  - Extreme case: 60% education adjustment, 40% age adjustment


## Visualization Decisions

### December 17, 2024
**Graph Design:**
- Discussed visualization with Fred
- Created scatterplots comparing original vs. adjusted media consumption
- Used jittering to better display overlapping data points
- Used education and age subplots to show differential adjustment effects
- Rationale: Helps visualize patterns of measurement error adjustment

### December 18, 2024
**Results Presentation:**
- Created histograms showing distribution of simulated odds ratios
- Added notes of simulated odds ratios and original odds ratios
- Rationale: Facilitates direct comparison between simulated odds ratios in moderate / extreme cases and original odds ratios
